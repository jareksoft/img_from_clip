Simple tool which can create images from clipboard contents
and save it as file to specific directory automatically.

Images stored in the clipboard are converted to the target format.
If user copies raw SVG text (e.g. from various UI design tools,
which support "copy as SVG", the image will be stored as-is
if SVG conversion is used).

HTML rendering is also supported. If user copies HTML into clipboard,
the application will render the image into a document of specified
width. Rendering is done using QTextDocument engine, so results may not
be perfect.
